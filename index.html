    <p>I speak 5.5 diferent languages and they are English,Hebrew,Germen,swiss,HTML and CSS. English is my main language that I speak at home. Hebrew is what I speak at school. Germen is what I learnd when I lived in Switzwerland. Swiss is very similar to Germen so it only counts as half a languagen. HTML is what I am still learning in coding classes. CSS is also what im learning in coding classes.
